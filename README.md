üìä Prometheus-Based Real-Time System Monitoring Dashboard
This project implements a real-time system monitoring dashboard using Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. The dashboard captures live metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, and more, providing insights through Prometheus‚Äô native UI.

üîß Project Overview
Prometheus scrapes metrics from various exporters at regular intervals.

These metrics are queried and visualized using Prometheus‚Äô built-in graphing interfaces.

The setup runs inside a Docker container, demonstrating how containerization simplifies deployment and isolation of monitoring tools.

üê≥ Docker & Containerization
Docker is used to containerize Prometheus, which offers several benefits:

‚úÖ Portability ‚Äì runs the same across environments

üîí Isolation ‚Äì Prometheus runs in its own environment without affecting the host system

‚öôÔ∏è Ease of deployment ‚Äì a single command sets up the service

‚ôªÔ∏è Reproducibility ‚Äì consistent behavior across setups

Example Docker Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d --name prometheus \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  -v /full/path/to/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  prom/prometheus
Make sure to replace /full/path/to/prometheus.yml with the actual absolute path to your configuration file.

üìÅ prometheus.yml Configuration
A basic example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
global:
  scrape_interval: 5s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']

  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']
This config tells Prometheus to scrape its own metrics and system metrics exposed by node_exporter.

üöÄ Getting Started
Install Docker and ensure it is running.

Download or create the prometheus.yml file as shown above.

Run the Prometheus container using the command provided.

Visit http://localhost:9090 to access the Prometheus UI.

üîç Example Prometheus Queries

Metric	Query Example
CPU Usage	rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="user"}[1m])
Memory Usage	node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes
Disk Usage	node_filesystem_avail_bytes / node_filesystem_size_bytes
Uptime	node_time_seconds - node_boot_time_seconds
üìà Dashboard Output
Using Prometheus' UI, you can:

Run real-time queries on metric data

Plot metrics on graphs over time

Monitor resource consumption and performance trends

‚úÖ Applications
Local development system monitoring

DevOps observability and metric collection

Learning Prometheus and Docker fundamentals

Following queries were executed:
 go_gc_heap_allocs_by_size_bytes_sum
Context: Go runtime (garbage collector).

Meaning: Total number of bytes allocated on the Go heap, grouped by allocation size.

Usage: Helps analyze memory allocation patterns and spot memory bloat or inefficiencies.

2. go_gc_cycles_automatic_gc_cycles_total
Context: Go runtime GC.

Meaning: Total number of automatic garbage collection (GC) cycles that have occurred.

Usage: Indicates how frequently the Go runtime is automatically triggering garbage collection. High numbers could imply a memory-intensive workload or frequent allocations.

3. go_sched_latencies_seconds_count
Context: Go scheduler.

Meaning: Count of observed scheduling latencies (i.e., how long goroutines wait to be scheduled).

Usage: Higher counts, especially with high latency, could signal CPU contention or goroutine scheduling issues.

4. prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_sum
Context: Prometheus server itself.

Meaning: Total time (in seconds) spent handling HTTP requests.

Usage: Used in conjunction with the _count metric to compute average request duration:

css
Copy
Edit
rate(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]) 
/ 
rate(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m])
This gives the average request duration over the last 5 minutes.
